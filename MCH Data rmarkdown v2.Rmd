## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}

```{r}

## Including Plots

```{r}
#histogram by county  

lbwdata %>% 
  filter(Year == 2014 & !is.na(rate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(County, rate)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 1/2))
 
#heatmap 
library(maps)
CaliforniaCounty <- map_data("county", "california")
head(CaliforniaCounty)

CaliforniaCounty %>% ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) + 
                  geom_polygon(fill = "white", color = "black") +
                  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(), 
                        panel.background = element_blank(),
                        axis.title = element_blank(), 
                        axis.text = element_blank(),
                        axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
                  coord_fixed(1.3)

california_map <- lbwdata %>% full_join(CaliforniaCounty, by = c("County" = "subregion")) %>% mutate(rate = Events/Total.Births * 10^2)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
